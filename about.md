I am a developer and ops engineer with more than 18 years of experience in
everything from systems administration to network security and heavy software
development.Â I was recently Head of Operations and Architecture at [MyDrive
Solutions](http://mydrivesolutions.com/) in Guildford, UK, and a Lead Site
Reliability Engineer at New Relic. I'm co-author, with Sean Kane, of
*[Docker: Up and Running](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920036142.do)*
from O'Reilly Media.

I'm currently looking for my next gig.

I can also be found [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/#!/idlehands) and [on Github](https://github.com/idlehands/).
